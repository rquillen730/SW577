Introduction

Overview

In an effort to complete this study, data was collected from a variety of sources, including The Centers for Disease Control (suicide rates), The United States Census Bureau (population), SSTI (PCPI), NCSI (Unemployment), and the American Hospital Directory (Hospital Count). All figures collected, aside from those reflected in historical suicide rates, are representitive of historical figures reported in 2010. Suicide rates were collected from 2005 - 2017; for the purpose of statistical analysis, suicide rates for the year 2010 will be utilized in order to remain consistant with other data present in this study.
This exploration aims to explore the connection between suicidality, per capita personal income, unemployment, and hospital availablity in an effort to gain insight into ways to lower the overal suicide rate.

The overall rate of suicide in the United States has been on the rise since 2007, as illustrated below.
